# basic-user-authentication-api
## This web api application was built as I want to understand how basic user authentication works.

By completing this web api application, I learned the following;

1. Generating JWT Token using Claims
2. User Authentication and Role-Based Autorization 
3. Determine the accessibility of API endpoint based on the user roles
4. Using Entity Framework to connect asp.net with SQL server
5. Implementing data annotation to validate user input
